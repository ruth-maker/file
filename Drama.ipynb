    "Based on the datasets there are nine main genres; Action and Adventures, Drama, drama, Documentry, Classics, Art House and International, Musical and Performing Arts, Horror, Mystrey and Suspense, Animation, Special Interest, Kids and Family and there are also five main System Ratings; System R Rating, System PG-13 Rating, System PG Rating, System G Rating and System NR Rating. In this Project the genres that are being chosen are Action & Adventure, Drama, drama, Classics and Art House and International which will all have indivisual data analysis based on the same data visualization concepts and the system ratings are being compared among one another and also analyised to view which one best fit the genres. There will be eleven differnt graphs for each genres describing and protarying insights on the activity of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Graphs\n",
    "These are the elven main graphs.\n",
    "  - __Profit Percentage baised on cost__:\n",
    "     - This data visualization shows the name, cost, profit, the type of system rating and profit percenatge by cost. The purpose of this notion is to view past the profit and better understand how successful the movie really is by analysing the cost and calculating how much more was made compared to it. This allows the idea of higher profit dosn't mean more profitable to be considered as a justification based on the results proving so. The system rating were added to be compared among eachother, to observe which one was better and to also know which one was the best fit for any particular genere by calculating the average of the reults of each system rating\n",
    "   \n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    "  - __Gross Profit Margin Percentage__:\n",
    "     - This data visualization has two pionts about the movie on one panel. The fisrt piont shows the name, amount of profit made in dollars, type of system rating and Gross Profit Margin Percentage. The other piont shows the name, revenue made in dollars and the type of system rating. The graph was designed this way to compare the profit amount against the revenue amount, allowing the Gross Profit Margin Percntage to be more visible and inderectly see the expenses made from a graph perpsective.\n",
    "     \n",
    " \n",
    " - __Budget and Revenue of Movies__:\n",
    "    - This graph is a scatter plot with an x-axis and a y-axis, the x-axis is the revenue of the movies in dollars and the y-axis is the budget of the movies in dollars. This graph is a blueprint to better understand  wether the amount of money spent on the movie effected the amount of revenue generted and to also spot movies that spent less money than the average with a higher revenue.\n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    " - __Revenue of Movies/Budget of Movies__:\n",
    "    - The revenue graph has an x-axis that shows the revnue of the movies, name and the type of system ratings with no y-axis. The budget graph has an x-axis that shows the budget of the movies and also the name and system ratings with no y-axis. Both graphs have a table split into catagories of the system ratings showing were they are postions in the axis. These graphs were constructed to predict how much will be made depending on how much is spent based on the pattern of budget of movies to revenue of movies and to indirectly spot anomalies.\n",
    "    \n",
    " \n",
    " - __Movies that mdae Profit__:\n",
    "    - This graph simply shows all the movies that made profit, from the highest to the lowest.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " - __Movies that had losses__:\n",
    "   - This graph is a colunm graph that shows the movies that did not make any profit. It shows the cost of the movie, revenue and by how much was not made to prevent a loss by the movie. It also shows the name and system ratings it belongs to. This dilema was created to percieve what agenda was not making any money, to try and understand the other half of film industry that is overlooked.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   \n",
    " \n",
    " - __Top 20 Highest Profitable Movies/ Top 20 Lowest Profitable Mobies__:\n",
    "    - The top 20 highest profitable graph is a 3D chart that shows the top 20 most profitable movies with an x-axis being the names of the movie and the y-axis being the amount of profit made in dollars. The top 20 lowest profitable graph is also a 3D chart that shows the top 20 movies that had the lowest profit, with the x-axis being the names of the movie and the y-axis being the amount of profit made in dollars. These graphs were creted to really spot what movis were the kings and queens of the movie industry and what movie was barely making sales. This brings a lot of questioning to what each of the movies did do britiantally or failed to do.\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "- __Most Successful Moive__:\n",
    "   - This graph is built up of two sections, the first section is an x-axis whcih shows the names and a y-axis which shows the budget, revenu and profit of the movies in dollars, the second section compares the gross profit margin percentage to the profit percnatge by cost of the movies whcih is all compared to all other movies in the data frame. The sections data is based on the top 20 most profitable movies. The concept of the visualization is to  dive deep into detail to anlayze what movie were actually more succesfull than the other, other than just focusing on the highets profits made. Factors like budget and revenue expressed in gross profit margin percentage and proft percentage by cost allows the differences among the most profitable movies to become more disguishable, whcih can open a new perspcetive on anyalzing numbers.\n",
    "   \n",
    " \n",
    " - __Tickets Sold__:\n",
    "    - This graph simply shows what system ratings have the highest tickets sold to better understand what audience best fist this genre through the sales of the system ratings."

    " - 3. The style of this graph is a Becker's Barkey Trellis Plot which is found in Altair's Gallery. There are two pionts shaped as a ring in each panel, the first ring projects the Renvue and the other ring projects the Profit, this set up allows the perseption of how much of a fraction do each movie actually walk away with when compared to the Revenue allowing the Profit to be seen from a differnt angle. This could make the movie look more profitable or seem over-rated. Each ring when hovered shows the Name of the movie, the Type choosing beteween Profit or Revenue, the Type Yield which is the amount of the Type in dollars, the Gross Profit Margin Percentage and the System Rating. The closer the Profit is to the Revenue the more buoyant it is!"

    "- The graph used for this visualzation is Highcharts Lollipop series which is found in the Highcharts Demos. Lollipop charts are variants of column charts, with a circle marker for the data value and a line extending to the axis.The first approach to this chart is by understanding the format of the script. This graph has two types of code HTML and Javascript. JupyterLab has magic commands that supports HTML and Javascript, it uses the '%' syntax element for magics.\n",

    "   Before the HTML and Javascript are scripted a dataframe needs to be made to extract all the movies that made profit in the action and adventure genre. The two variable needed from the parent dataframe '_all_drama_info1_' is the name and profit made in integer. \n",

The chart rotation chart series have an Alpha, Beta and Depth angle which can be adjusted to rotate the graph around.\n",
